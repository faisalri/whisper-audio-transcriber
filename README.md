## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting: Missing FFmpeg

The whisper library, particularly when processing audio files like .mp3, .m4a, or .ogg, relies on a command-line tool called FFmpeg to handle the audio decoding and conversion. If you encounter a FileNotFoundError, it means FFmpeg is not installed or not in your system's PATH.

You can install FFmpeg with a package manager like Chocolatey in PowerShell.

PowerShell

`choco install ffmpeg-full` 

Alternatively, you can manually download the builds from a trusted source and add them to your system's PATH.
